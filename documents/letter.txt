Dear Freddy Mallet,

I'm a C# .Net software engineer looking for new challenges. I'm programming in C# since 2009. I understand most of OO langage's internals based on my internship courses and my end-of-studies project eventhougth i didn't keep in touch with langage theory stuff. That's particularly why i find your job offer highly attractive. I'm curious by nature, "how it works ?" is a common question with me and working with you may be a great opportunity to me to understand deeply how C# langage works.

Yours faithfully,

Christophe Fajardo
